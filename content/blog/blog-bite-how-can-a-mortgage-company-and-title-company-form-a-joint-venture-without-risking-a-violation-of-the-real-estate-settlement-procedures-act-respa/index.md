[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/29697/Outsourcing/Is+Your+Joint+Venture+a+Sham+in+the+Eyes+of+HUD+As+Seen+Through+the+Real+Estate+Settlement+Procedures+Act) is a guide to the evaluative criteria used by the *Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)* in determining whether a **joint venture** between a mortgage company and title company is a "sham controlled business arrangement." 

In sum, the joint venture should operate as an autonomous entity with its own employees and facilities.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
