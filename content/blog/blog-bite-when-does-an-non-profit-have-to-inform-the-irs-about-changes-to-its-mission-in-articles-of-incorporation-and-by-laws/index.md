[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/294976/Corporate+Commercial+Law/Informing+Regulators+When+You+Alter+Your+Mission) seeks to answer the question of when does the tax authority need to be notified when a non-profit changes their mission. 

The article is written by a US attorney and is concerned with information requirements to the *US Internal Revenue Service*.  However the topic is *relevant* to **incorporations worldwide** who should consider the issues presented, to determine whether any local reporting requirements have been triggered by updated articles of incorporation, by-laws or other constating documents, or by an updated business mandate in general.

This "blog bite" comes to you as a part of Clausehound's collaboration with Mondaq!
