This article [Canada: "Substance Over Form" In Defining A Security](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/549010/Securities/Substance+Over+Form+In+Defining+A+Security) discusses an Ontario court decision that **promissory notes** are securities under the *Ontario Securities Act*, unless they are more akin to the types of notes considered to not be securities, using the 'family resemblance test'. If the promissory notes are akin to a lien on assets by a small business, the notes are less likely to be characterized as securities.
