### What is this document?

A **Share Buyback Notice** is a notice to a corporation that a shareholder is transferring shares of the corporation to the corporation for a stated price (the share buyback amount) under a Share Buyback Agreement. It is also an acknowledgement and receipt that the payment of the share buyback amount has been made in full.

 

### When would I use this document?
If the buyback rights under a Share Buyback Agreement have been triggered and the corporation wishes to exercise its rights to buy back the shares, the corporation would send this notice, along with a mechanism for payment, to the shareholder who is required to sell the shares back to the corporation. 

 

### Who Signs this Agreement?
This agreement is signed by authorized representatives of the corporation and the shareholder/transferor.

 

### More details about this document
While the document is drafted as if the shareholder is initiating the process of selling its shares back to the corporation, it is usually the **corporation** that would trigger this process. Under a Share Buyback Agreement, a corporation can have the right (but not necessarily the obligation) to buy back its shares from a shareholder if various triggering events occur eg. the shareholder terminates its employment with the corporation, or the shareholder dies or becomes bankrupt.

This document contains a transfer of the shares, a power of attorney for the corporation to transfer the shares to itself, and a receipt and acknowledgement that the share buyback amount has been paid to the (former) shareholder.

 

### What are the core elements of this document?
