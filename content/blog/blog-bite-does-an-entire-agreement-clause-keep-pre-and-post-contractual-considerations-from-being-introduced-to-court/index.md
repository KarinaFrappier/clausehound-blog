["Canada: Court Of Appeal Clarifies Enforceability Of Entire Agreement Clauses"](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/420940/Contract+Law/Court+of+Appeal+Clarifies+Enforceability+of+Entire+Agreement+Clauses), uses case law to discuss the enforceability of entire agreement clauses since courts are more and more taking into account **pre-contractual and post-contractual details in cases**. To circumvent this, the clause should explicitly address such matters.
