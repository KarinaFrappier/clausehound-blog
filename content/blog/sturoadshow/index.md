Sniffing out awesome startup events, we’re venturing out of the doghouse to check out StartupTech Unleashed’s roadshows in [Toronto on February 27th and in Waterloo on February 28th](http://startuptechunleashed.com/event-calendar/)! 

 

[StartupTech Unleashed](http://startuptechunleashed.com/monthly-meetup-events/)’s events offer an intimate environment that will give you a chance to see some great startups in all different fields, to learn from other founders, partake in great speaker sessions, engage in demos and much more. Their 2017 Roadshow tour is designed to highlight and showcase innovative talent in the Toronto & Waterloo startup and tech communities. They help bring local founders, tech enthusiasts, and investors together to showcase new talent and ideas and to foster innovation.

 



 

This is StartupTech’s inaugural launch of roadshows and summits and they are on a mission to promote  growth and support talent in the North American tech ecosystem! StartupTech Unleashed started out as a simple group to help share ideas, foster support and assist fellow business owners. It has evolved from a small business group to a large organization with members and events in multiple cities.
