Clausehound’s partner organization, **Propel Entrepreneurship**, has shared a feature on one of their fantastic student-run startups based at Western University. 

North In Focus, a startup founded by students Gabrielle Foss and Patrick Hickey, is a completely student-run organization that aims to promote mental health in Canada’s North through youth-oriented workshops. The initiative taken by these students is a prime illustration of  the positive impacts that a startup can have on Canadians. If have a cause which you’re passionate about, it’s never too early to start a business!
