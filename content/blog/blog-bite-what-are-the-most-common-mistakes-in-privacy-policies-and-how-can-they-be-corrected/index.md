[United States: Ten Common Problems That Plague Privacy Policies](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/523558/Data+Protection+Privacy/Ten+Common+Problems+That+Plague+Privacy+Policies) explains some of the most common errors found in privacy policies. 

First, the author explains that many companies fail to tailor their privacy policies to their jurisdiction. Second, many businesses fail to modify their privacy policies after data collection practices have changed. Third, the author explains that most jurisdictions require that the link to privacy policies be conspicuous to users. Many businesses fail to comply with privacy lies as their links are hidden at the bottom of websites. Finally, the author suggests that businesses refrain from making impossible promises in their privacy policies. Businesses should not guarantee that the data of users will not be sold or shared to third parties.
