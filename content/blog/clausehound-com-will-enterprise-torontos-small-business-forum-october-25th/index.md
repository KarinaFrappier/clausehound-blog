September 19, 2016 Toronto, ON:

This post is to remind subscribers that on October 25, 2016, between 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM, Clausehound.com will be featured at **Enterprise Toronto’s Small Business Forum** located at the Toronto Metro Convention Centre. Clausehound continues to celebrate new achievements by offering OUR BIGGEST SPONSORSHIP PACKAGE EVER to attendees of Enterprise Toronto’s Small Business Forum. The Small Business Forum hosts over 2,500 entrepreneurs and provides an exceptional lineup of speakers, including Mayor John Tory. Clausehound is excited to meet many of Canada’s best up-and-coming entrepreneurs and small businesses at the Small Business Forum!

### Who we are: 
[Clausehound.com](https://about.clausehound.com/) and our [$10 per month small business law library](https://www.clausehound.com/documents/) is cloud-based software for entrepreneurs, small businesses and lawyers alike to help with the drafting of legal documents. Clausehound hosts tens of thousands of legal clauses, contracts, articles, lawyer commentary and instructional videos. We even offer a concierge service (pro feature) should you have any questions while trying to source an agreement.



In conjunction with this announcement, **Clausehound will be offering free one month subscriptions to our Small Business Law Library** (which allows the unlocking and download of three legal documents) to the **first 100 visitors to come by our booth** at the event located at booth #203 - come by our booth and receive your free gift!

Clausehound.com will also be hosting a ‘fishbowl contest’ in which event attendees can drop a business card into our fishbowl for the chance at winning a one year subscription to Clausehound’s Small Business Law Library including access to our concierge (a pro feature).  Our concierge will source documents for you that do not presently exist in our library.   The value of this promotion is $600, a great prize for the lucky winner.  

Clausehound.com is proud to be participating in such a great startup event, and we look forward to showcasing our new product to Toronto’s startup community.

**So come and check us out on On October 25th between 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM.**

We hope to see you there!
