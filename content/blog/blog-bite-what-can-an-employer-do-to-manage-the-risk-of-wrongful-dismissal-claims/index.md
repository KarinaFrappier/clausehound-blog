[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/254798/employee+rights+labour+relations/Qubec+Law+The+Top+10+Reasons+Not+to+Prematurely+Terminate+an+Employment+Relationship) cautions against hasty termination of employees and briefly sets out guidelines to minimize the risk of wrongful dismissal. Chiefly, employers should record all incidents requiring **disciplinary action** in employee records, and use disciplinary action commensurate to the misconduct. Termination should be a carefully considered last resort.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
