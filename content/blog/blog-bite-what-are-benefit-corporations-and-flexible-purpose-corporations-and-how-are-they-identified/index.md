The article [United States: California's New Entities: Benefit Corporations And Flexible Purpose Corporations](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/166230/Corporate+Company+Law/Californias+New+Entities+Benefit+Corporations+And+Flexible+Purpose+Corporations) discusses benefit corporations and flexible purpose corporations, two subtypes of traditional business corporations that can be organized under the California Corporations Code (as of 2012). These allow the directors of a corporation to pursue interests other than solely those economic interests of its shareholders; for instance, directors can make decisions to address social objectives (e.g., environmental health).

The author notes that to be recognized as one of these subtypes, a corporation must include a specific statement in its Articles of Incorporation, identifying that corporation as either a benefits corporation or a flexible purpose corporation.
