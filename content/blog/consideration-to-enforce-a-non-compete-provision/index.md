### Discussion:

In the sale of a business, the agreement of the vendor not to compete may be part of the consideration by agreeing to acquire the business. Consider *1400467 Alberta Ltd. v. Adderley (2012 ABQB 155)* in which the vendor of the business sold had an interest in a direct competitor. The court considered (among other things):
- the merits of a restrictive covenant in the context of an employment agreement where such a covenant was part of the consideration for the sale of the business; 
- [on “consideration”] the reasonableness of the restriction, and whether it was patently against the public interest; in this case, this covenant assisted the purchaser of the business to ensure that the purchase price paid for the business “was not money thrown to the wind.”

- Also on “consideration”:
The court did note that consideration for the restrictive covenant was in the amount of $10, which, because of the breadth of the covenant, immediately attracts concern about a potential imbalance in contracting positions, in the context of a strictly employment-related relationship (which it was not).
