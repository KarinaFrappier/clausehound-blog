[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/560364/Patent/Update+on+CRISPR+Patent+Battle) discusses an ongoing patent battle between the *University of California* and the *Broad Institute* over the control of patent rights related to a revolutionary gene editing technology, “CRISPR”. While the University of California was first to file its patent application, the Broad Institute exercised a “priority examination option” to have its applications reviewed more quickly. 

The author highlights the complexities of this ongoing battle to highlight the risks associated with publicly disclosing ground-breaking research findings, especially when their most valuable applications await being realized in practice. For deal negotiators who are drafting **licensing agreements** and/or **patent applications**, take a read of this article and pay attention to the confidentiality provisions of your **licence or transfer agreement**, and consider the necessity of a freedom to operate search in advance of public disclosure of your business or technology processes.
