[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/china/x/259502/Cartels+Monopolies/Noncompete+clauses+in+JV+contracts+An+analysis+from+the+perspective+of+the+PRC+Antimonopoly+Law) discusses whether a **non-competition clause in a joint venture agreement** is permissible under *China's 2008 Anti-Monopoly Law*. 

Citing a number of reasons, it argues that a non-competition clause would not, on its face, be considered a violation of the legislation and could be enforceable. It also recommends that certain steps be taken when negotiating such a clause to help ensure its enforceability.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
