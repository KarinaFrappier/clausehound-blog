Dear [INSERT NAME OF CLIENT], 

 

The IP Transfer Agreement is in progress of being drafted and I wanted to provide a high-level list of what provisions will be included in your IP Transfer Agreement. I believe this list captures the discussions we have had regarding the content and language of the Agreement. 

 

 

**1. Name of Parties & Place of Business:**
 
- Party: HoundCo
- Place of Business: 

- Counterparty: Jane Joe
- Place of Business:

**2. Consideration:**
For example ‘Transfer price’ or amount of shares being transferred

**3. Price determined in CAD or USD?**

**4. Description of the IP:**
Please review Recital A and Recital C. Are there are any additional IPs that are not included that you wish to have included in the agreement?

**5. Full and final release:**

 

Please review these terms carefully as they will be drafted into the IP Transfer Agreement.

 

Thank you and we look forward to completing this Agreement by September 15, 2017.

 

Best Regards,

 

[INSERT NAME][INSERT POSITION][INSERT FIRM NAME]
