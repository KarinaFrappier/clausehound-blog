This post is to inform our readers that Clausehound.com will be featured at the **Legal Innovation Zone's Industry Night** on November 9, 2016. The event will take place at the Legal Innovation Zone (10 Dundas Street E, 10th Floor). Industry Night will operate from 6-9pm on that evening. Clausehound is excited to be pitching our business to the crowd that evening, so please come to learn more about legal technology and innovation!

### Who we are: 
Clausehound.com and our $10 per month [small business law library](https://www.clausehound.com/documents/) is cloud-based software for entrepreneurs, small businesses and lawyers alike to help with the drafting of legal documents. Clausehound hosts tens of thousands of legal clauses, contracts, articles, lawyer commentary and instructional videos. We even offer a concierge service (pro feature) should you have any questions while trying to source an agreement.



In conjunction with this announcement, **Clausehound will be offering free one month subscriptions to our Small Business Law Library** (which allows the unlocking and download of three legal documents) to all visitors of Industry Night! Speak with us on November 9th to receive your promotional code!

[Clausehound.com](https://about.clausehound.com/) will also be hosting a ‘fishbowl contest’ in which event attendees can drop a business card into our fishbowl for the chance at winning a one year subscription to Clausehound’s Small Business Law Library including access to our concierge (a pro feature).  Our concierge will source documents for you that do not presently exist in our library. The value of this promotion is $600, a great prize for the lucky winner.  

Clausehound.com is proud to be participating in such a great legal technology event, and we look forward to showcasing our new product to Toronto’s legal and tech communities.

We hope to see you there!
