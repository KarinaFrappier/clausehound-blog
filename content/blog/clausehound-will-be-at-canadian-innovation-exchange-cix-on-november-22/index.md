This post is to inform our readers that Clausehound.com will be featured at the **Canadian Innovation Exchange (CIX)** on November 22, 2016 hosted by MaRS Discovery District.

### About CIX:

The Canadian Innovation Exchange (CIX) is a leading technology event whereby investors, innovative and technology companies, entrepreneurs and service providers alike converge to collaborate, drive business, and contribute to Canada’s economic growth and development. Many of the key players behind Canada’s technology industry will be attending CIX in order to speak with various business providers, network with potential customers or providers, and pursue collaborative opportunities with other businesses. 

Attendees will have the opportunity to learn from one another and encourage the development of innovative technology that will be an integral part of Canada’s economic growth in the future. Attendees include technology entrepreneurs, startups, investors, advisors and media. 

### Who we are: 

[Clausehound.com](https://about.clausehound.com/) and our $10 per month small business law library is cloud-based software for entrepreneurs, small businesses and lawyers alike to help with the drafting of legal documents. Clausehound hosts tens of thousands of legal clauses, contracts, articles, lawyer commentary and instructional videos. We even offer a concierge service (pro feature) should you have any questions while trying to source an agreement.



Clausehound.com will also be hosting a ‘fishbowl contest’ in which event attendees can drop a business card into our fishbowl for the chance at winning a one year subscription to Clausehound’s Small Business Law Library including access to our concierge (a pro feature).  Our concierge will source documents for you that do not presently exist in our library. The value of this promotion is $600, a great prize for the lucky winner.
