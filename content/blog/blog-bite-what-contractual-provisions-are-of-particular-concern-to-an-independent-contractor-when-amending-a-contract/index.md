[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/79130/Contract+Flash+Points+Part+4+What+To+Look+Out+For+As+A+Contractor+The+Devil+Is+In+The+Detail) posits that **amendments to contractor agreements** are rarely, if ever, made for the benefit of the contractor. As such, it is imperative for contractors to remain vigilant regarding seemingly innocuous amendments to certain provisions such as extension of time, entire agreement clauses, and site risk clauses. 

The author quotes extension problematic amendments made to these clauses from the *Joint Contract Tribunal standard-form contracts* which caused several problems between his contractor clients and the party hiring them.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
