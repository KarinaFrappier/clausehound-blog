[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/332368/Corporate+Commercial+Law/Use+A+Shareholders+Agreement+To+Become+A+CCPC+Even+If+The) refers to a recent Tax Court of Canada decision to make it clear that a corporation can now receive the tax benefits offered to **Canadian-Controlled Private Corporations (CCPCs)** even though the majority of its shareholders are non-residents.

The author uses the case to show that even if the majority of voting shares lies with non-resident shareholders, if the resident shareholders have the ability to elect a majority of directors, *de jure control* (or control in law) will be deemed to reside with the resident shareholders; the corporation is thus allowed to enjoy the tax benefits as a CCPC. A carefully drafted shareholders' agreement that limits the control of non-resident shareholders can help ensure this outcome.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
