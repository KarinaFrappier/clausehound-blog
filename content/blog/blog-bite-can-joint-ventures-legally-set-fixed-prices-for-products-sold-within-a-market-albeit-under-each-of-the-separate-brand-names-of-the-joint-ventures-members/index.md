[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/38704/Trade+Regulation+Practices/Joint+Venture+Did+Not+Engage+in+per+se+Illegal+Price+Fixing+When+it+Set+Prices+for+its+Own+Products) discusses a US Supreme Court decision where the court held that two traditional competitors that form a joint venture can, pursuant to the purpose of the venture, set a fixed price for products sold under each of the joint venture's members brand names. 

Because the core activity of the venture itself was the pricing of products, this was not illegal anti-competitive conduct.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
