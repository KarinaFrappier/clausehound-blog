[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/518056/Contract+Law/Dangerous+Alliances+Is+Peter+Druker+right+about+Joint+Ventures) critically examines the claim that **joint ventures are riskier** than other contracting structures. It concludes that they are not, provided that parties seeking to avoid fiduciary obligations also avoid JVs or establish **robust dispute resolution mechanisms**.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
