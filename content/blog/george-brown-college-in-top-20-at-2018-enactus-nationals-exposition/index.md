Our partner organization **startGBC** recently celebrated their top 20 finish at the Enactus Nationals Exposition.

With projects such as Change Matters, a program for customized lesson plans; Girls Gowing Forward, a business mentorship program for youths in low-income households; and Spudlery, cutlery made of potato skins to combat plastic waste, these results do not come as a surprise!
