[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/525942/employee+rights+labour+relations/Arbitration+Clauses+In+Employment+Agreements+Are+They+Enforceable) explores the enforceability of mandatory arbitration clauses in employment agreements. Citing *Morrison v. Ericsson Canada Inc*, the author cautions employees against initiating legal proceedings on matters subject to arbitration as the action can be stayed.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
