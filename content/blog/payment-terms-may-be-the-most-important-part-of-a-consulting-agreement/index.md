While it seems obvious that billing and payment of expenses should be clearly dealt with in **consulting contracts**, many parties fail to address such details as: 
- What happens if expenses are submitted late? 
- Are original receipts required? How will payment be made? 
- What types of expenses are covered? What is the procedure for authorizing expenses? 
- Will verbal authorizations be accepted?

Other key concepts for consulting contracts include: 
- ownership of IP
- warranties by the consultant of the quality of their work
- confidentiality, and 
- cancellation/termination of the contract

Consultants should carefully review the contractual description of the project. It is important that both parties are clear on the extent of the work to be done. Equally important are any **schedules to the agreement**. These schedules often contain some of the most important details.
