Our partner organization **Multiplicity** is excited to announce their next accelerator program!

Multiplicity is now joining forces with TWG and the Global Accelerator Network to launch the Toronto location of the **Startup Boost Global Pre-Accelerator**. StartupBoost was previously a TechStars program entitled StartupNext and Multiplicity is a co-founder of this new global program. 

Startup Boost is a 6-week jump-off point for post-incubator pre-accelerator companies to refine their processes, product design, customer and investor pitch prior to application into an accelerator program.This is a global acceleration program that is hosted in seven cities worldwide; it is a great opportunity to make some great connections with other up-and-coming startup companies in Toronto and worldwide, and to get ready for the next stage of their growth.

If you're interested, you can apply [here](https://www.f6s.com/startupboosttoronto/); be sure to do so by September 26!
