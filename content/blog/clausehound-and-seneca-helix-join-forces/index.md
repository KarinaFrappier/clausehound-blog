**About HELIX 101:** Seneca HELIX is dedicated to developing the entrepreneurial mindset. We accomplish this by providing knowledge, mentorship, sessions, work space, access to like-minded peer community, and experiential opportunities. HELIX focuses on two important outcomes:

- The development and launch of successful, scalable and sustainable, young entrepreneur-led ventures.
- Nurturing the entrepreneurial mind set to allow participants to become intrapreneurs and innovate from within companies.

**About DealPrep:** DealPrep is a legal tool geared towards entrepreneurs, early-stage businesses and small businesses alike to help draft legal documents when they are at stages of development that make it cost-prohibitive to hire a lawyer. The DealPrep Business law Library hosts hundreds of legal contract templates, as well as tens of thousands of legal clauses, contracts, articles, and lawyer commentary that will help you learn the fundamentals of legal drafting.

We’re are both very excited to be working together to support up-and-coming entrepreneurs in the pursuit of their business dreams!
