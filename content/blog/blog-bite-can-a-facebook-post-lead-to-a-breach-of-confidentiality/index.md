[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/307948/employment+litigation+tribunals/aughters+Facebook+Post+Leads+to+Costly+Breach+by+Father+of+a+Confidentiality+Clause+in+His+Settlement+Agreement+With+Former+Employer) deals with an ex-employee breaching confidentiality by informing his daughter of the outcome of a settlement agreement (prohibited by the NDA) which led to her making a public *Facebook* post about the outcome. 

This case stresses the importance to always be mindful of the information you share with others, especially confidential information restricted by an NDA.
