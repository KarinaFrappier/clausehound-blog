[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/474600/employment+litigation+tribunals/Take+Care+in+Drafting+Meschino+v+Frazier+Industrial+Co+is+a+Cautionary+Tale+for+Employers) discusses a case where an employment agreement superseded a confidentiality agreement.
