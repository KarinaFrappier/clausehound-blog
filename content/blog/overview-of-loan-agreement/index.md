### What is this document?
A **Loan Agreement** is a contract made between a borrower and lender. It establishes the terms of the loan.

This document is used whenever money is lent by one person to another.

 

### Who signs this document?
Loan Agreements are signed by the Borrower and the Lender. If acting on behalf of a corporation, the agreement should be signed by someone who can bind the corporation. 

 

### More details about this document
Loan Agreements can range in length depending on the complexity of the loan and how the payment will be paid. In some cases loans can be paid in a lump sum or can be paid in installments over a specified period of time. Lenders will include an **interest clause** in the document stipulating what interest rate is to be paid on the loan amount, and when interest payments are due. 

To reduce the risk that the borrower might not pay the amounts owed under the Loan Agreement, the parties may agree on **collateral or security** to be part of the deal. This can allow the lender to dispose of the borrowerâ€™s collateral (e.g jewellery, shares, vehicles, accounts receivable etc.) to obtain the money owed if the borrower defaults on the loan.
