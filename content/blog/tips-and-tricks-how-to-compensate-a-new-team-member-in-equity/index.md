Startup companies often struggle with the **valuation calculation**, and how to determine the **number of shares to issue** to a new team member.

A good place to start when thinking about this are the Khan Academy’s Raising Money for a Startup, and Getting a seed round from a VC videos for an excellent and thorough discussion on how to value **founder equity vs. new investment**.  Where the investor is investing cash – think of the new cash as the “sweat equity” provided by your new team member.

Suggested viewing:

Once you have had a chance to view the videos, consider that the principles of valuation of **time vs. money** can be extended to new “sweat” investors by adding additional boxes of value to the table, and issuing a corresponding number of shares to match.  Think of the sweat and cash in the company prior to adding on the new founder as the pre-money valuation, and the additional value added by the new investor as post-money valuation.

You may wish to “drip” out the vesting of shares over time.  Several instruments can be used for compensating the new team member, including a consulting agreement or option agreement, or both, combined.

Be sure to **consult your accountant** to discuss the form and value of new shares issued (vs. for example options), as there may be a *Canada Revenue Agency* revenue amount triggered, if this share issuance is treated as compensation or company earnings and not an investment.
