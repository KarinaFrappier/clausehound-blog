This article argues that maximizing shareholder returns is not the best way to run a sustainable for-profit corporation. The author points to several **"B Corporations"**, or **benefit corporations** which do a much better job of engaging their workforce than **traditional for-profit corporations**. 

A 'B Corp' measures its success across five (5) metrics: employees (pay more than the competitors), customers (charge less than the competitors); community (contribute more than the competitors); environment (reduce impact); and shareholders (pay a bit less...but still be very successful). 

The article describes several very successful B Corps. One of these businesses has recently implemented an **ESOP**, not as a strategy for retaining employees (their wages are already higher than the competitors), but as a strategy for uniting the interests of various groups including employees, shareholders and community.

### Takeaway:
- ESOPs can be used effectively in corporations focused on the welfare of the community.
