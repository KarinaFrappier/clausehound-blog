### Approve the Form of the Share Certificates
Conventionally, a sample of each share certificate to be used for each class of share is prepared, the word "SAMPLE" is printed on its face and the certificate is inserted into the corporation's minute book. The directors must then approve the form of the share certificates in a resolution.

### Corporation's Registers
Once the corporation has been organized, the various registers found in the corporation's minute book must be completed and maintained at its registered office.

### Directors’ Register
The Directors’ Register lists the names of all the directors, along with their addresses, the date on which each became a director and the date on which any ceased to be a Director.

### Shareholders’ Register
The Shareholders’ Register lists the names of all the shareholders, along with their addresses, the date on which each became a shareholder and the date on which any ceased to be a Shareholder.

### Share Register
The Share Register (or Shareholder Capitalization Table) lists, in alphabetical order, the name and address of each shareholder for each class of shares, along with the date on which the shares were issued or acquired by transfer, the share certificate number, the issue price paid for each share, the total amount paid upon issue and the aggregate number of shares held by each shareholder.  Shareholders have the right to review this register at any time. As such, it should be kept up to date.

### Share Transfer Register
The Share Transfer Register contains a list of all share transfers that have taken place over time, including the number and date of the transfer, the name of the transferor and transferee, the number of shares transferred and the certificate numbers that were cancelled and issued.
