### When would I use this document?

When engaging in a business relationship, **written executed documents** are *preferable* to verbal agreements. Both parties to an agreement should read the agreement in its entirety and should have the agreement reviewed by a lawyer before signing it.

### Who Signs this Agreement?

Agreements are typically signed by the ‘**parties**’ - individuals, partnerships or corporations who will be bound by the agreement. The agreement will give the parties both benefits and obligations. Whoever is intended to be bound by the agreement should sign to provide evidence that the deal terms have been accepted. When corporations sign an agreement, the agreement should be signed by an individual who has signing authority on behalf of the corporation. Signing is also called ‘*executing*’ the agreement.
