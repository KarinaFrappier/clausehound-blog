[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/436154/Shareholders/In+many+ways+the+relationship+between+the+shareholders+of+a+company+is+akin+to+that+of+a+marriage) explains the benefits of a shareholders' agreement by analogizing the agreement to a marital agreement, that you hope to never need it, but are happy it is there when needed. The author discusses **compulsory buy-out clauses** and how they benefit both parties.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
