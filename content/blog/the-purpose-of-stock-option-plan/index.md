**Stock options** are often issued as a part of a company’s incentive program to the company’s and its subsidiaries’ key persons who are working on the company’s projects. The purpose of the stock options is to give personnel a *financial incentive* to work hard to increase the company’s shareholder value. This is a common strategy with businesses as the employees can see their connection with their work and the company they are staying with.

### Takeaway:
- Stock options can encourage employee performance but their value is often out of the employee control. Any negative fluctuations could result in a loss of motivation and the opposite is also true, where positive fluctuations will encourage performance.
