This article is about a lawsuit alleging fraud by the supplier, who controlled the distributor, in the form of **exorbitant distribution fees**. "The effect of Weinstein’s (the supplier) scheme was to utilize the Distribution Agreement to transfer to Weinstein, as a result of Weinstein’s ownership of the Debtor, the Debtor’s cash by charging the Debtor above-market rates in the Distribution Agreement instead of the net revenues that could be obtained if the Distribution Agreement reflected market terms and industry norms."

Agreements which are overly-biased in favour of one of the parties are more likely to be terminated early, or result in financial difficulties for the 'junior' party.

### Takeaway:
- One sided distribution agreements are less likely to succeed.
