People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as:
- (1) minimum director requirements; 
- (2) favorable corporate taxes; 
- (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. 

The article [Ireland: Ireland - Company Incorporation](http://www.mondaq.com/ireland/x/326076/offshore+financial+centres/Ireland+Company+Incorporation) describes the features of a corporation in Ireland, notably that the company must have a real and substantive presence in Ireland and not merely a local registered office. The article highlights further requirements, including number of directors, registered office, and restrictions to company name.
