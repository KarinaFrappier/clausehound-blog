Drafters of commercial lease agreements should beware when drafting the **minimum rent clause**. An option to renew an agreement can oblige the landlord to offer to renew for the original (lower) rent, although the rental market may have increased.

A lease signed in 2002 permitting the *Knights of Columbus* to rent 3,800 square feet of second-floor space — including a meeting area and bar/kitchenette — for the grand sum of $1 a year, may in turn prevent the sellers from selling the metropolitan centre. The idea for the **“sweetheart lease”** may have been a reward for the Knights’ willingness to sell. As the vendors have discovered, even rent as cheap as $1 can be valid for 100 years.

### Takeaway:
- When drafting the minimum rent clause, landlords should consider whether they want to give the option of renewing the terms, including minimum rent, and the impact this may have on a future sale of the property.
