[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/471596/employee+rights+labour+relations/WorkForHire+Clauses+and+Agreements+One+Key+to+Intellectual+Property+Ownership) highlights the importance of obtaining the broadest possible rights in **intellectual property** created by an independent contractor in the course of their work for the hiring party (also known in the US as "*work made for hire*"). 

Without a properly drafted work for hire clause, a hiring party may not have rights to intellectual property created by the independent contractor. Where the risk of misclassifying a worker exists, in order to protect the business's interests in the intellectual property, contracts should also include clauses governing the **complete assignment of rights** in a work over to the business.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
