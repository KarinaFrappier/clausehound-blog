[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/164854/Contract+Law/Joint+Venture+Partner+Has+An+Obligation+To+Act+In+Good+Faith) relies on a recent judicial holding to illustrate that parties of a **joint venture agreement** may have an **implied obligation** to act with good faith. 

The article also uses the holding to show that parties to a joint venture agreement may have fiduciary duties to each other.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
