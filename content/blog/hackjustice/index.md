Sniffing out awesome startup events, we’re venturing out of the doghouse to check out HACKJUSTICE’s two day ‘hackathon’ taking place on February 3rd and 4th. The hackathon will bring together legal professionals, students, computer scientists, members of the public, and professionals of various disciplines to code and create technology applications that will improve access to justice. Organized by the The Winkler Institute for Dispute Resolution at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto & the Cyberjustice Laboratory at the Université de Montréal, the event aims to develop technological solutions that will make justice more accessible for all.

 

 

Each team will have the opportunity to present their tech solution to panel of judges who will choose the hackathon winners based on the originality and usefulness tech developed. [Clausehound.com](https://www.clausehound.com/documents/)’s Founder, Rajah Lehal, is excited to be part of the [Challenge Committee](http://www.hackjustice.ca/challenges-2/challenge-committee/) and will be included as a judge of this year’s event! 

 



 

Keep your eyes peeled for members of [Clausehound.com](https://www.clausehound.com/documents/)’s team at all access to justice events! As members of the legal tech community, we take great pride in promoting the use of technology to make legal support more accessible and affordable for all! 

 

This sold-out event will be taking place both in Toronto and Montreal, and it will be broadcasted live from both locations! The Toronto portion of the event will be at MaRS Discovery District (Room CR-3) located at 101 College Street, while the Montreal portion will be at the Cyberjustice Laboratory located at 3200 Jean-Brillant.
