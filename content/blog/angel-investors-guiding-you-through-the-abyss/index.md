So you have an **idea**.

It starts in your head and your excitement leads you to bring it to the world.

You describe it to some folks.  Some of those folks understand it, some don’t.  Some question you on your ideas, telling you it won’t work.  Some of them tell you it’s a good idea.  You press on.

The idea takes shape into a **product**.

You describe it to more folks – some of the same, some new.  Describing it now requires less imagination.  Some people question you on your ideas, telling you it won’t work.  Some of them tell you it’s a good idea.

So you **run out of money**.

And you start to do **meetings**.  Please sir, or madam, can you spare some funds?  We are not the right stage for you?  For any of you?

*Every time you run out of money, and you get a helping hand, somewhere an angel gets its wings.*

Funds come in from your family and you get to keep going.  The product starts to take more shape.

You describe it to more folks – some of the same, some new.  Your product description requires even less imagination than before.

Some of these folks who said you aren’t ready, they are watching you.  You have stayed in touch, listened, assessed advice, adapted.  You have persevered, not discouraged by staff turnover, struggle, or the startup budget.  You have survived and they are fascinated.  How did you manage to keep it going, and to get customers?

Maybe you’re worth a second look.

They polish you and they prod you.  They question you and mock your deck, they irritate you.

They are guiding you in the only way you will listen.  With criticism.

But they were right.  Your story needed polishing.  So you polish and prod and change things.

They are patient.

You go back and demo again.  The **polish** is obvious and you have more customers.  A lot more.

Then they say the sweetest words: I am in.  Send the legal documents.

*I believe in you Rajah.*

You get to continue to journey into the abyss.  But now with a flashlight, with a sherpa, and a friend.

With an angel.
