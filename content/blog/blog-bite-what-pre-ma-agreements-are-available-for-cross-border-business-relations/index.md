[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/13551/PreAcquisition+Agreements+In+Mergers+And+Acquisitions) expands on **confidentiality agreements**, **standstill agreements** and **letters of intent** as they are used during mergers and acquisitions. 

In recent years, confidentiality agreements have expanded to include expansive definitions of the information they pertain to, as well as the rights and obligations of the parties.

Restrictions on uses of the information and the categories of people to whom the information may be disclosed must be clear. Lawyers and accountants are often involved.
