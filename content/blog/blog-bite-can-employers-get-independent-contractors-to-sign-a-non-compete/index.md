[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/246534/employee+rights+labour+relations/No+No+No+Your+Independent+Contractor+Cannot+Sign+A+Noncompete+Never+Ever) states that independent contractors can sign **confidentiality agreements**, but employers who wish to maintain the independent contractor status (e.g., to avoid compliance with employee protection laws) *cannot require* them to sign **non-compete agreements** (which only employees should sign). 

The specialized nature of the services provided by independent contractors makes the chance that he or she is working for an employer's competitors highly likely, and thus a non-compete absurd.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
