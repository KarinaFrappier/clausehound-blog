This article [Canada: Waivers Of Subrogation In Leases – The Latest Chapter](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/220932/Insurance/Waivers+Of+Subrogation+In+Leases+The+Latest+Chapter) situates the use of the **mutual release agreement** within the context of insurance and risk. 

For example, if a landlord is obligated to insure a rented building, and the tenant is expected to insure personal property on the premises, the parties may release each other for damages and losses covered by their respective insurance policies. Through a discussion of *Williams-Sonoma Inc v EllisDon Corporation*, an Ontario case, the author explores how this regime applies.
