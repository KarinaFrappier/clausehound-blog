[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/631682/Contract+of+Employment/Employment+Contracts) deals with employment law in Quebec. 

It succinctly recaps the different types of employment relationships (i.e. a contract of employment versus a contract for services). When it comes to **reasonable notice**, it reveals Quebec relies on case law to calculate it as there are no set guidelines to determine what constitutes reasonable notice. A prominent theme reiterated in the article is that an employee is protected by **human rights and privacy considerations** which means that an employerâ€™s right to medical exams, background checks, credit checks, psychological and/or aptitude tests are limited.
