### Independent Contractors

As any business, if you do not have the skills necessary to create software that your company needs, you can look towards independent contractors. When entering into a software development agreement and creating the Master Services Agreement (MSA), it is necessary to define the scope of the work that you want performed. Clear expectations between both the client and the developer will prevent conflict in the future.

### Scope of Work

As an overview, a scope work will often include clauses about the following items:

- A list of key personnel and assigned persons
- Training to customer personnel that will be included as part of the project
- Physical deliverables such as: media, equipment, reports, documentation, user guides, etc.
- Warranty period
- Software hosting
- Support and maintenance
