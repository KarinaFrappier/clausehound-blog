The article [Canada: Limitation of Liability Clauses: Are They Enforceable and Effective](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/411990/Building+Construction/Limitation+of+Liability+Clauses+Are+They+Enforceable+and+Effective) uses case law to discuss the reach of **limitation of liability clauses**. For example, when a party to a project has a subcontractor who engages in negligent misrepresentation, the clause remains in effect to protect the party but not the subcontractor, who is held liable for full indemnities.
