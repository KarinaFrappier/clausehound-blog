With the market recovering and stabilizing in 2014, ESOP's became very popular in the financial sector. ESOP's are a tool for the retention and motivation of employees, and the return to strong markets encouraged firms in the financial services to issue ESOPs to retain their top talent. 

The **ESOP retention tactic** was not just popular with private banks, but are also became more popular with state-owned banks. This is evidenced in the example of the *Bank of India* who considered issuing ESOP's to their employees. Public banks have difficulty retaining talent, compared to private financial institutions, and are hoping their ESOP's will have a positive effect on the retention of their talent pool.
