With the help of [Multiplicity](https://www.multiplicitylabs.com/), a Toronto-based nonprofit that provides education and mentorship to startups (and co-founded by Clausehound.com CEO Rajah Lehal), INFINITI launched its first North American-based **INFINITI LAB** in early spring 2017. INFINITI LAB is returning to Toronto for a second year, and again aims to grow companies focused on Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city initiatives.

Throughout this six week program, startups will benefit from intensive one on one mentorship from INFINITI, Multiplicity and external subject matter experts. They will also have the opportunity to pitch to the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi $1 Billion Alliance Ventures.

Applications for INFINITI LAB Toronto are already open, and the program is open to pre-seed startups who work in IoT and smart city innovation. The application deadline is May 23rd, and starting May 30th until the end of the six week program, the selected startups will benefit from intensive one on one mentorship from INFINITI, Multiplicity and external subject matter experts. They will also have the opportunity to pitch to the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi $1 Billion Alliance Ventures.
