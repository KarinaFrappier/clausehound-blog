### Annual General Meetings
The CBCA requires that the directors of a corporation call the first annual general meeting (an “AGM”) no later than eighteen (18) months after incorporation. Thereafter an AGM must be held at least every fifteen (15) months, but no later than six (6) months after the end of the corporation’s fiscal year.  Each director must be notified in writing five (5) days in advance of the date, time and place of the meeting.

During an AGM, shareholders shall elect directors to hold office, appoint officers and auditors, make and approve banking arrangements, adopt a corporate seal, set a fiscal year, approve the form of the share certificates, and receive financial statements in accordance with the by-laws of the corporation or with the rules set out in the CBCA. These actions are evidenced by corporate resolutions.
