Clausehound’s partner organization, **Collage**, has written an eye-opening blog on the most common labour infractions in Ontario, as determined by the Ministry of Labour’s ‘Workplace Blitz’ report. A shocking 74% of employers inspected were found to be in violation of Ontario’s labour laws. 

Collage provides simple advice on how to proactively address these concerns so that your company remains in good standing with the Ministry of Labour. This is a must read for all employers, as non-compliance with Ontario labour laws can be both time consuming, expensive, and have a detrimental effect on employee productivity and morale.
