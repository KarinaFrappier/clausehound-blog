[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/288916/Securities/Exploring+the+PPSA+The+Impact+for+Joint+Ventures+and+the+Resources+Sector) points out the effect the **Personal Property Securities Act (PPSA)** can have upon documentation for joint ventures. 

For example, its broadened definition of security interests could apply to typical exchanges of rights (e.g., cross securities, acquisition in the event of default) between parties to a joint venture, therefore requiring registration to be completed.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
