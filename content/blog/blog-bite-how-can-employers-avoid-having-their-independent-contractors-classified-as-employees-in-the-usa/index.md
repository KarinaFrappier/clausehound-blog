[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/314132/employee+rights+labour+relations/If+Exotic+Dancers+Arent+Independent+Contractors+Who+Is) discusses how employers can avoid having their **independent contractors classified as employees**. 

The author discusses recent cases to suggest that employers should refrain from: having significant control over independent contractors; providing extensive training to independent contractors; paying for the expenses of independent contractors; subjecting independent contractors to the same rules as employees, such as drug tests; preventing contractors the right to provide services to other companies; providing tools to independent contractor; hiring independent contractors to perform tasks that are integral to their businesses.
