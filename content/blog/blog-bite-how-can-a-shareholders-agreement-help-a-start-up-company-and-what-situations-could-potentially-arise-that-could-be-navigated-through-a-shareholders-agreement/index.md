[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/355562/Shareholders/Foundations+For+Startup+Success+The+Shareholders+Agreement) discusses the use of a **shareholders' agreement** to confront the challenges that arise when building a successful company.

A properly drafted shareholders' agreement can roadmap the foreseeable and unforeseeable twists and turns associated with growing a business. The article lays out scenarios that could be adequately dealt with through a shareholders' agreement. These scenarios include: if one person wants to sell and others do not; if investors are requiring the formation of a board of directors but the partners do not want to lose control of the company; and if one partner leaves who has a required knowledge or skills set for the company to run adequately.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
