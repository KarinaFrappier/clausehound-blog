People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as:
- (1) minimum director requirements; 
- (2) favorable corporate taxes; 
- (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. 

This article [India: MCA Notifies The Incorporation (Amendment) Rules, 2017: Doing Business In India Further SPICe-d And Digitized](http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/565572/Corporate+Commercial+Law/MCA+Notifies+The+Incorporation+Amendment+Rules+2017+Doing+Business+In+India+Further+SPICed+And+Digitized) highlights key changes to the rules for the incorporation of a company in India.
