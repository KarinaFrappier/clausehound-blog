[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/364514/Contract+Law/Terms+Of+Written+Loan+Agreement+Prevail+Over+Contradictory+Oral+Evidence) discusses the main issue of whether extrinsic evidence should be considered if it contradicts the evidence of the contract. It was found that a **collateral contract** will not be admissible if it contradicts the **main written contract**. This is relevant for entire clause agreements because the court noted that there was no entire agreement clause, a term that no party can amend the agreement unless it is in writing was effectively an entire agreement clause.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
