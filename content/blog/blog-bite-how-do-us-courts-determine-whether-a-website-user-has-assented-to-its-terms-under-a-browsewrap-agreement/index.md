[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/342684/IT+internet/Website+Terms+and+Conditions+What+Constitutes+Acceptance+A+Recent+US+Case+Casts+Doubt) refers to a *US Court of Appeals decision* to state that Canadian companies, especially those conducting business in the US, should be mindful of how US courts determine whether a user will be bound to the terms under a **browsewrap agreement**. 

The US courts have held that because no affirmative action is required by a user to assent to the terms, whether it binds that user will depend on whether he or she had actual or constructive knowledge of them.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
