[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/181318/International+Law/The+Contractual+Duty+Of+Good+Faith) states that the inclusion of an **expressed duty of good faith** can have several consequences to parties of a **joint venture agreement**. 

Parties will likely be obliged to observe reasonable commercial standing of fair dealings, disclose any facts that may be material to the other party, and adhere to the spirit of the contract.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
