[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/584100/Redundancy+Layoff/Termination+Of+Employment+In+Ontario) provides a concise overview of what costs are involved in terminating an employee in Ontario. 

It uses a key piece of legislation, the *Employment Standards Act 2000*, to summarize what a termination means including a discussion of the different types such as **constructive dismissal** and **temporary layoffs**. Employers will benefit from the section on how to calculate written notice and special rules concerning **mass layoffs** while employees will appreciate understanding how termination notice or pay in lieu of notice is calculated. 

A bonus feature of this article is that it clarifies when common law notice applies and what factors are used to assess damages.
