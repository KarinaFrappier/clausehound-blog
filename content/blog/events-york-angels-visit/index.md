"The York Angel Investors are a group of accredited investors with a broad range of professional experience. Our focus is to create a superior return on investment for ourselves and the businesses we work with.

Our collaborative mentorship approach and strategic financing supports entrepreneurs through various stages of early growth. Our investments often represent the bridge between the self-financed or seed stage and the venture capital and/or private equity level of funding." - York Angels
