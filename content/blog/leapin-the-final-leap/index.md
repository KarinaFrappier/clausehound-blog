Our partner organization **LeapJunction** has published an article detailing the successes of their most recent Leap-In Cohort.

[LeapJunction](https://www.leapjunction.ca/leap-in) shares with us information about the program, some cool statistics and a few great takeaways.

This is important for anyone interested in or considering business incubation, in understanding the benefits of both the LeapJunction program specifically, and in business incubation or acceleration programs in general.
