### More details about this document
In general, Bills of Sale are used to prove that an item has been sold by the seller to the buyer, and are most useful in private cash transactions. Buyers should keep the Bill of Sale to be able to prove that they have a right to the item, and that they have the right to sell the item to another person. The Bill of Sale is also a receipt for the purchase price, and gives the buyer proof that the seller has been paid. A Bill of Sale is required in most jurisdictions for the registration of the transfer of ownership in motor vehicles.

A Bill of Sale can be quite simple, setting out the buyer and seller information, a description of the item(s) sold, the date of the sale, the price (including taxes), a transfer of ownership, and a description of any liens. The Bill of Sale used with an Asset Purchase Agreement is an unconditional agreement to transfer the ownership in the listed assets and an acknowledgement of receipt of the payment. It states that the seller has the right to transfer the assets and that the buyer shall have the right to the assets without any claim from the seller, and functions as a type of release of the sellerâ€™s claims against the assets.
