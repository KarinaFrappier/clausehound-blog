The article [Canada: A Canadian Perspective: Choice of Law and Choice of Forum](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/39956/Contract+Law/A+Canadian+Perspective+Choice+of+Law+and+Choice+of+Forum) discusses how the courts favor leaving the decision of governing law up to the parties. Limits arise only if the contract is illegal (which can in part result from being contrary to public policy or morality) or the choice is not bona fide (does not make commercial sense).
