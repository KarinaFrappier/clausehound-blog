[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/269068/Charities+Non-Profits/The+15+Most+Common+Nonprofit+Bylaw+Pitfalls+How+To+Avoid+The+Traps) informs the directors, officers, and other staff of non-profit organizations of the **fifteen most common pitfalls** with respect to their corporate by-laws and the ways to avoid them. 

For instance, the author notes that non-profit organizations can more appropriately reflect the governance arrangements of the organization by making use of newer non-profit corporation acts to establish "*designated bodies*" that hold power under the corporate by-laws.

We note that the pitfalls found here are also pitfalls that would potentially befall a for-profit corporation, so this article is a worthwhile read for any new incorporator or corporate secretary.
