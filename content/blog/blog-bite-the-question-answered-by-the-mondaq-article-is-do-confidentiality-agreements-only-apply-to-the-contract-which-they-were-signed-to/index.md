[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/361456/Contract+Law/A+Duty+Of+Confidentiality+Continued+During+And+After+A+Contract+Was+Entered+Into) discusses how a **confidentiality agreement** may continue to carry over beyond the initial agreement into **subsequent agreements** even if the subsequent agreements make no mention of it. 

In the case discussed in the article the courts showed that they are prepared to enforce the confidentiality via **injunctions**.
