[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/493290/Whistleblowing/Do+Your+NonDisclosure+Agreements+For+Employees+And+Contractors+Satisfy+The+New+Notice+Requirements) discusses the significance of two immunity provisions that apply to **whistleblowers** contained in new federal law (the *Defend Trade Secrets Act*). The provisions mandate that notice of the clauses be included in agreements executed between employers and employees or independent contractors where such agreements govern the use of trade secrets and other confidential information. 

The author notes the significance of the new law for employers, as it limits employers' indemnification rights where employees fail to comply with the notice requirement. The author also notes how employers can comply with the notice requirement by updating their employee and independent contractor agreements appropriately.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
