This article [UK: High Court Permits University's Contravention Of Its Own Privacy Policy](http://www.mondaq.com/x/518358/Data+Protection+Privacy/High+Court+Permits+Universitys+Contravention+Of+Its+Own+Privacy+Policy) discusses a recent case where the High Court permitted a university to disclose personal information of a student accused of sexual assault. **Disclosing the information** without the consent of the student was in violation of the university's privacy policy. 

Although the Court ruled in favour of the university in this case, the authors note that organizations could avoid potential lawsuits if their privacy policy states the potential of disclosure for criminal, fraudulent or legal purposes.
