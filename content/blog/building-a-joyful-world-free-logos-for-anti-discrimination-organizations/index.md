Our partner organization **Logojoy** released an article about their newest initiative to provide free logos for anti-discrimination organizations.

With the recent horrible events of Charlottesville, Logojoy has decided to start this initiative to help bring an end to hartred in our world.

This is important for everyone because the current climate of our work is something that can't be ignored and Logojoy is taking a good step in the right direction.
