[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/x/266580/Venture+Capital/Joint+Ventures+Implied+Fiduciary+Duties) discusses **implied fiduciary duties** into joint venture agreements, specifically the duties to act in good faith and to not misuse venture revenues. 

The author uses the first U.K. Court of Appeal decision that confirmed this legal principle to note that cautious drafters should clarify the scope of duties owed in the joint venture agreement itself in order to ensure that they will be enforced by courts.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
