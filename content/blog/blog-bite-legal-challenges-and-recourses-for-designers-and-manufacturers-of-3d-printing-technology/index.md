[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/trademark/389148/ip-strategies-for-the-rise-of-3d-printing) discusses the intellectual property challenges for designers and manufacturers of products amidst the advancements of 3D printing technology.

The author notes (among other things) that: rights holders in fact have few options to pursue when they discover an infringement upon their rights; finding a direct infringer may require expending significant resources; and Supreme Court decisions make it ever more difficult to target manufacturers of 3D printers for copyright infringement where there are legitimate purposes to the copying.

This article describes recourses available to companies, as well as proactive activities to establish intellectual property ownership using design and utility patent applications, trademark registration, and copyright law, among others.
