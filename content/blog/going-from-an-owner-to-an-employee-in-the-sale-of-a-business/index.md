In the sale of a business, sometimes the previous owners (the “ex-owner”) are asked by the purchasers to stay with the company for a fixed time period to help transition existing clients or customers to the new ownership. In this case, such ex-owners are usually required to enter into an **executive employment agreement** with the new company. 

However, problems may arise when the purchase price for the business is directly tied to the retention of the company’s customer/clients (also referred to as an **earnout**). This is because if the ex-owner’s employment agreement with the company is terminated, the retention of the customers/clients may also drop, which in turn would negatively affect the purchase price. For this reason, it is very important for ex-owners in a similar situation to negotiate strict termination clauses into their executive employment agreement.
