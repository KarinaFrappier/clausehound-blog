People sometimes want to register in other jurisdictions for reasons such as:
- (1) minimum director requirements; 
- (2) favorable corporate taxes; 
- (3) employer or corporate incentives for hiring locally, among others. 

The article [Brazil: Establishing A Company In Brazil](http://www.mondaq.com/brazil/x/332058/Corporate+Governance/Establishing+A+Company+In+Brazil) discusses the method in which a foreign company may establish itself in Brazil, either through a branch or subsidiary. 

The article suggests that establishing a presence in Brazil through subsidiary is more common. Limited liability companies and corporations are the most common approach to establishing a subsidiary. The article further discusses the steps to incorporation and the difference between LLC and corporations.
