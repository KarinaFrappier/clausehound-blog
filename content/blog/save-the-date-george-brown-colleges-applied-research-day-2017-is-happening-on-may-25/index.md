There’s a lot happening for industries in Toronto, and applied research plays a big part in shaking those industries up. The importance of gathering knowledge and applying it to problems to produce solutions for people is at the heart of what more and more businesses are aiming to do. 

Clausehound is one of them, and has spent a lot of time at **George Brown College (GBC)** working away. As a result, we are pretty excited about GBC’s Applied Research Day 2017. It’s happening on Thursday, May 25 at 51 Dockside Drive, down by the Waterfront in Toronto! 

Expect a day full of networking with industry professionals and learning from promising students about their applied research and the room for innovation expected in those industries. Registration is free.
