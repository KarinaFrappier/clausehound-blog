[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/Nigeria/x/549676/Building+Construction/An+Appraisal+Of+Essential+Provisions+To+Protect+The+Interest+Of+The+Main+Contractor+In+A+Subcontract+Construction+Agreement) explains ways a main contractor can protect itself in a **subcontract agreement**. The author suggests that the main contractor should ensure that the scope of the work, subcontract price, completion of work clauses should be *consistent* with the main contract. Furthermore, the author suggest that the main contractor should require the subcontractor to acquire its own insurance protection. Lastly, the author suggests that the subcontract agreement should contain its own **dispute resolution clause**.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
