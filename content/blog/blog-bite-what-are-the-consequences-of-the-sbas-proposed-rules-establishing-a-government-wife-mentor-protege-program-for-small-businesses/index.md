[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/561482/Corporate+Commercial+Law/SBA+Proposes+Rules+to+Establish+a+MentorProtg+Program+for) discusses how the SBA issued proposed rules that would establish a government-wide **mentor-protege program** for all small business types. 

These proposed rules include: 
- an exception to not be considered affiliates on the basis of the approved mentor-protege joint venture; 
- restricting whether a joint venture may be populated or not; 
- joint ventures being required to submit an annual report to ensure compliance with the SBA regulations and joint venture agreements; and
- the SBA wanting to track awards to joint ventures.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
