[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/196444/Corporate+Tax/Effect+Of+A+Unanimous+Shareholders+Agreement+On+CCPC+Status) is about how relevant the provisions of a **unanimous shareholders' agreement (USA)** are for determining tax status particularly as a Canadian controlled private corporation (CCPC).

The author discusses this decision and notes that for this taxation status, *de jure control* of the corporation must be considered including the USA. This case would allow flexibility for taxation insofar as it could allow corporation with non-resident majority shareholders to receive tax credits.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
