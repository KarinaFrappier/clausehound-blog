[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/391400/Government+Contracts+Procurement+PPP/Confidentiality+Agreements+of+Federal+Contractor+Employees+Changes+To+The+Federal+Acquisition+Regulations+Are+Coming+Soon) discusses the **changing regulations** after a federal statute was enacted that prohibited federal funds to go to corporations who had confidentiality agreements which prevented the employees from reporting fraud, waste, or abuse to agencies. The author identifies that the proposed regulations will apply to *new contracts*, but current contractors may be required to update their confidentiality policies. The author makes it clear that there are risks in this policy.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
