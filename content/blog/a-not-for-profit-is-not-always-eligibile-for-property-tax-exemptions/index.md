Status as a not for profit corporation does not automatically qualify a corporation for exemption from property taxes. The *legal tests* vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may vary between **property tax and income tax legislation**. Some jurisdictions may require restrictions on business activities and associations as part of the legal test for tax exemptions.

In this article, a medical center in New Jersey failed to meet the requirements/legal test of a non-profit organization for property tax purposes. A tax court Judge ruled that a medical center in New Jersey should pay property taxes on virtually all of its 40-acre property in town. Central to the decision was the judge's observation that the not for profit hospital also had "labyrinthine corporate structures, intertwined with both non-profit and for-profit subsidiaries and unaffiliated corporate entities."

### Takeaway:
- Not for profit corporations that are intertwined with for-profit corporations may not be eligible for property tax exemptions in some jurisdictions.
