["UK: Entire Agreement Clauses"](http://www.mondaq.com/x/144800/Contract+Law/Entire+Agreement+Clauses), discusses the importance of **explicit language in entire agreement clauses**. To prevent a claim for negligent misrepresentation, a clause must either state that no representations have been made, no representations have been relied upon, or explicitly state that parties will not be liable for any misrepresentations.
