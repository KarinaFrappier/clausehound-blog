[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/568810/Unfair+Wrongful+Dismissal/Perspective+On+The+Probationary+Period+And+Termination+Rights+In+Ontario) examines what “probation” means to both an employer and an employee in respect of **obligations and rights on termination**. 

In particular, it explains what a probationary period is and its legality in Ontario. The article is relevant because it delves into how the concept of probationary period is different at common law than under the *Employment Standards Act, 2000*. For example, one difference regarding termination is that the Act sets out minimum standards that employers must adhere to while common law obligations can often impose higher standards.
