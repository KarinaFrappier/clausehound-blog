["Australia: Entire Agreement Clauses - What Do They Seek To Do? Do They Work?"](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/82978/Arbitration+Dispute+Resolution/Entire+Agreement+Clauses+What+Do+They+Seek+To+Do+Do+They+Work), discusses the **range of legal consequences that entire agreement clauses have**. The clause will only have the effect of excluding implied terms if the language of the clause explicitly excludes implied terms. In some cases, the clause will not exclude express terms if a party can prove that the written agreement does not represent the actual agreement of the parties.
