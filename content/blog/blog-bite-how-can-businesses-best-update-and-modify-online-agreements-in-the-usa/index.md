[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/488856/IT+internet/The+Law+And+Business+of+Social+Media+Status+Updates) the author advises businesses on how they can **update terms of use agreements**. 

The author recommends websites make users agree to the modified terms of use *before* they are able to log in to the website. The author also discusses the alternative option of notifying users in advance of *upcoming terms of use changes*. While one court has upheld a terms of use agreement after a user was notified in advance of modifications, the author does not recommend this approach.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
