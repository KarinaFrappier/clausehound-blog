[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/535694/real+estate/Bhasin+Two+Years+On+The+Impact+Of+Bhasin+V+Hrynew+On+The+Practice+Of+Canadian+Commercial+Real+Estate+Law) notes that the duty of good faith previously existed in the context of **commercial real estate transactions**. 

But the article is most useful because it highlights key aspects of commercial real estate matters that were not addressed in *Bhasin* such as caveat emptor (“buyer beware”), the right of first refusal, and letter of intent but then attempts to illustrate how the ruling in Bhasin would potentially impact these areas.
