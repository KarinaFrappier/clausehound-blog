[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/388024/Social+Media/Is+Your+Social+Media+Influencer+or+Blogger+an+Employee+or+an+Independent+Contractor+What+Companies+Need+To+Know+Before+They+Engage+Bloggers+and+Other+Independent+Contractors) discusses the benefits and, more importantly, the risks associated with designating workers as **independent contractors** in a contract (e.g., risk of litigation for misclassification lawsuits, costly audits by pension, tax, and employment agencies). 

The author provides three (3) tips for companies who wish to minimize these risks: honestly assess the nature of working relationships, have the parties' intent as to the independent contractor's status clarified in a contract, and seek counsel to review classifications if necessary.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
