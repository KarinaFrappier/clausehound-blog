According to this article, from 2000 to 2012 productivity went up about 25%, but wages increased only about 7%. Where is the wealth going? Most US citizens do not realize that most federal tax incentives for employee stock ownership and profit sharing — billions and billions over decades — go to subsidizing shares for the top five executives of stock market companies.

This article argues that US federal and state governments should update and meaningfully expand the **tax incentives** for every business in the country to seriously consider offering lower risk broad-based cash or deferred profit sharing plans, employee stock ownership plans such as an ESOP, grants of restricted stock, or a stock option plan to all of their workers.

### Takeaway:
- Fairly structured ESOP's may be a mechanism for promoting employee engagement and improved financial stability of the middle class.
