### What is this document?
The **Corporate Minute Book** is a collection of documents that forms the official record of the activities of the corporation, beginning at incorporation. It should include all documents related to the formation and management of the corporation, and all major contracts. 

 

### When would I use this document?
Every corporation should maintain an up to date and organized minute book. The Minute Book is subject to examination by financial auditors and potential lenders and investors, who will be concerned about whether corporate actions were properly authorized.

 

### Who Signs this Agreement?
The Minute Book is a collection of documents, each of which is signed by the person(s) authorized to do so. Most documents will be executed by the shareholders and directors of the corporation in accordance with the relevant legislation, the Articles of Incorporation, the by-laws and any shareholders’ agreement.

 

### More details about this document
Because the Minute Book is a collection of documents, it can be organized into a binder (or collection of binders, depending on the number of documents) with tabs dividing it into the core elements. For assistance with this, see the ‘*Minute Book Cover*’ document on Clausehound. 

Many corporations also keep electronic versions of the Minute Book for ease of reference. It is important to scan and file executed documents promptly to keep the Minute Book up to date, and to prevent the loss or ‘misplacement’ of important documents. It is a good practice to review and update the Minute Book annually, and with every major transaction.

The core elements of the Minute Book are as follows:
1.  Corporate Filings including the articles of incorporation, the articles of amendment and the articles of amalgamation, and annual filings;
2. Consents that the directors qualify and agree to be directors of the corporation;
3. By-laws governing all matters related to the corporation;
4. Subscription Agreements for each shareholder to purchase shares in the corporation ;
