### What is this document?

An Employment Agreement is used to establish the relationship between an employer and an existing or new employee. It includes the obligations of both parties.  

### When would I use this document?

This document could be used either for a new employee or to change the terms of an existing employer/employee relationship.  

### Who signs this document?

Employment Agreements are signed by the new or existing employee and an individual with authority to bind the employer to the agreement. The Employment Agreement should be signed *after* the employee has had a chance to look it over, and *before* the employee begins work.

### More details about this document

Employment Agreements can range in length and complexity depending on the context it is drafted for. An employee will sign an Employment Agreement when starting a new position with an employer, and then periodically when the terms of their employment relationship evolve over time (eg. changes in position, compensation, vacation benefits, stock options, etc.). Employment Agreements often refer to *company policies* or *benefits plans*.
