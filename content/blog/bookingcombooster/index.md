[Clausehound.com](https://www.clausehound.com/documents/)’s community partner, [Impact Hub](http://www.impacthub.net/), is launching a social accelerator in conjunction with Booking.com. If you operate a startup that has a positive impact on the environment, preserves and promotes cultural heritage, or seeks to promote inclusive growth in tourism that supports local communities, we encourage you to apply to the [Booking.com Booster](https://booster.bookingcares.com/) by March 1, 2017 to be eligible for up to €500,000 in grants! 

 

About Booking.com Booster: The program will culminate with grants of between €100,000 to €500,000 given to a number of the finalist ventures, with a total pot of €2 million available. The accelerator will have 8-12 finalists who will be invited to Amsterdam from June 5-23 where Impact Hub Amsterdam and Booking.com will co-deliver a scaling accelerator. Finalists will receive mentorship from Booking.com and Impact Hub for 6-9 months following the accelerator.
