[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/252412/Contract+Law/httpwwwmondaqcomeditorialarticleasparticleid252164) reminds readers that third parties (in this case, affiliates or representatives of the receiving party) are not bound by the contract signed by the disclosing and receiving parties. 

It suggests requiring third parties to enter into a **separate agreement with respect to confidential information**, or to specify that the receiving party is responsible for the consequences if a third party takes unwanted action.
