With the help of [Multiplicity](http://multiplicity.media/), a Toronto-based nonprofit that provides education and mentorship to startups (and co-founded by Clausehound.com CEO Rajah Lehal), INFINITI has launched its first North American-based INFINITI LAB. The INFINITI LAB aims to grow companies focused on Internet of Things (IoT) and smart city initiatives.

Applications for INFINITI LAB Toronto are already open, and the program is open to pre-seed startups who work in IoT and smart city innovation. The program launches May 29th, and the group of selected startups will work closely with corporate and industry partners including Techstars, OMERS Ventures, TELUS Ventures and the City of Toronto (among others), who will provide the participants with access to technology, mentorship and education throughout the month-long program.
