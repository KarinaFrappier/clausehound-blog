Being an entrepreneur—and a successful one at that—is a herculean effort. It might look like a lot of fun, but a lot of work goes into trying to get a new business going. **Futurpreneur**, a partner organization of Clausehound’s, showcases one entrepreneur’s outlook on her life in this short piece. 

*Chakameh Shafii* is the CEO of TranQool, an online counselling service. She writes about how entrepreneurs need to remember to be selfish, and in more ways than one.

Selfishness is not just about taking time away from work to be with your family and friends or catch up with yourself (whether it be, she suggests, by working out or watching Netflix). Interestingly, she also posits that it is good for entrepreneurs to be selfish and take the time to do what you love by continuing to work away at your business, because as stressful as it can be it’s just as rewarding.
