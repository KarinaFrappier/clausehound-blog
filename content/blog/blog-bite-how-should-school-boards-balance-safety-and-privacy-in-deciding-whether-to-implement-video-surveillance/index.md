This article [Canada: Video Surveillance In Schools: Balancing Safety And Privacy](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/431126/Education/Video+Surveillance+In+Schools+Balancing+Safety+And+Privacy) discusses the importance of effective privacy guidelines, policies, and procedures relating to video surveillance on school property. 

The author uses two decisions, one arising in a labour arbitration and another arising from a privacy complaint, to state that in addition to ensuring compliance with other provincial or federal privacy law (e.g., Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act), school boards should consider the reasonableness in the circumstance of implementing video surveillance as well as whether alternative means available to maintain a safe and secure environment.
