Technology is developing at a quick pace, but so are cities. As cities get bigger, so too does the demand for growth in sectors like infrastructure, energy, and even niches like home improvement. Technology is smart enough to handle these demands, and thus smart cities are born. 

Clausehound’s partner organization **StartUp HERE Toronto** recently profiled the city’s Board of Trade and its aim to situate Toronto as a leader in the up-and-coming market of smart cities. In partnership with the **UK Department of International Trade**, local smart cities businesses are being sent out to London Tech Week, which starts on Sunday, June 11. It will be an enormous week chock-full of events that offer exposure to the latest developments in a variety of industries that have set their sights on the future of smart cities. Even more, delegates from around the world will be able to forge connections that offer them access to global markets.
