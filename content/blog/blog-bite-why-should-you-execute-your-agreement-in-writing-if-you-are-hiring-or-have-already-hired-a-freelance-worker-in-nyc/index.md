[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/597554/Contract+of+Employment/New+NYC+Law+Requires+Written+Agreements+For+Solo+Contractors+Even+Nannies+And+Babysitters) discusses the new *"Freelance Isn't Free" Act* in effect in New York City, and the new requirements it establishes for all hiring parties, whether a corporation or an individual, who engage services from freelance workers. The author brings readers' attention to the fact that the new law provides freelancers the right to file a **civil lawsuit for statutory damages** of $250 for the hiring party's mere failure to execute a written agreement. To avoid having to pay these damages, hiring parties should simply apply good business practice and have their agreements comprehensively set out in writing.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
