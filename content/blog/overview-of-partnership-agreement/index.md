### More details about this document
A Partnership Agreement enables business partners to establish ground rules for the business’ governance and operations. It is prudent to implement a Partnership Agreement regardless of whether a partnership is formed between friends, family members, or with strangers. 

Partnership Agreements dictate how a partnership will operate, and more specifically the responsibilities of each partner in terms of contributing capital to the business, division of profits, management decisions, dispute resolution between partners etc. Partnership Agreements are important because partnerships in Canada are *not separate legal entities* like a corporation. Individual partners have the capacity to bind the entire organization, including the other partners, and therefore it is important to outline each partner’s authority and responsibilities.
