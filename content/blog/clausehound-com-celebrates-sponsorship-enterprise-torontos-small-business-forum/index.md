To celebrate our first year of our Small Business Law Library, Clausehound is excited to be offering more than $10,000 worth of sponsored subscriptions to Enterprise Toronto subscribers and to visitors of the Small Business Forum!

Who we are: **Clausehound.com and our $10 per month small business law library is cloud-based software for entrepreneurs, small businesses and lawyers alike to help with the drafting of legal documents**. Clausehound hosts tens of thousands of legal clauses, contracts, articles, and lawyer commentary. We even offer a concierge service (pro feature) should you have any questions while trying to source an agreement.
