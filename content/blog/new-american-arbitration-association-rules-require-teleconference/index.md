The **New American Arbitration Association** rules require that parties must try to resolve issues first through a teleconference with an arbitrator. They will be permitted to file written motions only if they fail to reach an agreement on the issue during the teleconference.

The new rules apply to *consumer arbitrations* in the United States. The goal, especially of the manufacturing sector, is to expedite resolution of consumer complaints. Lawyers may find that the new rules are less liberal with respect to filing motions and requests for evidence than the rules applicable to the courtroom.
