[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/202300/Consumer+Trading+Unfair+Trading/ACCC+Focus+on+Website+terms+and+conditions) advises Australian businesses with an online presence to review their website terms and conditions to ensure compliance with the *Australian Consumer Law* by removing or re-drafting any terms likely to confuse or mislead consumers into believing they cannot exercise their statutory rights to request *repair, replacement or refund* of faulty products or substandard services. 

The warning comes after a wave of internet sweeps conducted by the **Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC)**.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
