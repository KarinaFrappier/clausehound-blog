**Clausehound is attending the Business Transitions Forum in a week on June 7 and 8, 2016.**

"The BUSINESS TRANSITIONS FORUM (BTF) is a multi-city conference for business owners that wish to learn how to plan for the eventual sale of a mid-market privately owned business. BTF demystifies the process of selling a business so that you can build a roadmap that will put more money in your pocket when the time is right to sell. Itâ€™s no secret that many businesses fail to transition successfully; BTF is your opportunity to efficiently gather information and hear from a variety of people who have experienced the transition process first-hand." - The Business Transitions Forum
