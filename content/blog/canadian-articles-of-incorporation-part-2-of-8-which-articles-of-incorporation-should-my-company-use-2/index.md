### Introduction

Upon considering whether one wants to incorporate their business *federally* or *provincially*, the next factor to consider is what the entrepreneur wants to achieve through their articles of incorporation. In order to determine this, it is crucial to consider who will be running the business, where will the business obtain its funding, whether there are any concerns that need to be mitigated, whether the individual is selling a product or performing services, etc.

You can see the various [Articles of Incorporation](https://clausehound.com/documents/) documents available through Clausehound, each of which addresses diverse circumstances your startup may face.
