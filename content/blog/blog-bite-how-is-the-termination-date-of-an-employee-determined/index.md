[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/276218/employment+litigation+tribunals/Employers+Need+to+Be+Clear+About+What+is+An+Employees+Termination+Date) talks about recent cases to illustrate the potential conflicts that can result from an uncertain termination date. The author states that conflict can be easily avoided if the employer sends a letter to the employee stating the **termination date**.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
