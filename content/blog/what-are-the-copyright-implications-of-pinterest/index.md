This article discusses the **copyright issues** associated with the use of the popular social networking site *Pinterest*. Pinterest encourages users not to pin their own items and cautions against self-promotion, but their **terms of service** contain representations and warranties about the ownership of all IP posted on Pinterest and non-infringement of third party IP. The article advises users to be careful about what they post on Pinterest.

Website operators may want to ensure that they avoid IP litigation by inserting representations and warranties such as these in their terms of service. Users should inform themselves of these representations and warranties (and possible indemnity provisions, in case of breach) and be wary about what they put on social media sites without a license from the IP owner.

### Takeaway:
- Website Terms of Use will not protect users from violating the copyright of third parties, so users should check the terms of use of the source site before copying the material.
