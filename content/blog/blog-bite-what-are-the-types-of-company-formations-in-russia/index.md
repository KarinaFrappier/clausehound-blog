[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/russianfederation/x/307026/Corporate+Governance/Company+Formation+In+Russia) details the various types of business entities in Russia and regulatory issues which may arise in a joint venture. 

Some **joint venture proposals** may require approval from *Russian antimonopoly authorities*. The business entities discussed include: 
- (1) a Russian joint stock company; 
- (2) a Russian limited liability company; and 
- (3) a non-Russian company with a wholly-owned Russian operating subsidiary.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
