[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/252080/Shareholders/Five+Beneficial+Clauses+To+Consider+When+Drafting+A+Shareholders+Agreement) explores five (5) of the most common clauses in **shareholders' agreements**: *shotgun clause*, *hard right of first refusal*, *soft right of first refusal*, *drag along provision*, and *tag along provision*.

If properly drafted, a shareholders' agreement that contemplates these provisions protects the interests of both controlling and minority shareholders.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
