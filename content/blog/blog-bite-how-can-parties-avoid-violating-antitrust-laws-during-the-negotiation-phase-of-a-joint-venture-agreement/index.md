[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/40122/EU+Law+Regulatory/Dont+Jump+the+Gun+with+Your+Merger+or+Joint+Venture+Partners) cautions against prematurely sharing information or integrating personnel before closing a joint-venture agreement. Such practices could be deemed to be in violation of **antitrust laws** set out in the *Sherman Act* and *Hart-Scott-Rodino Act* even if the parties are not direct competitors.

This comes to you as a part of Clausehound's exciting new collaboration with Mondaq!
