Have you ever actually, earnestly read a privacy policy?

No? I envy you. They’re pretty dry reading - and besides, most people don’t really feel they have a reason to until something goes horribly wrong - like the [2017 Equifax data breach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPjgRKW_Jmk) (they’re **still** dealing with the lawsuits).

But if you’re among the unfortunate minority which has, you’ll know that many privacy policies read like a contract. They can be full of technical words, complex sentences, and a bunch of cross-references that need you to scroll back and forth to make sense of everything.

Of course, a Privacy Policy IS a contract - so why should it be any less complicated than other contracts?

# Privacy Policies are Consumer Facing

Primarily, Ontario’s **Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)** is informed by certain [guiding principles](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda-compliance-help/guide_org/) such as accountability, accuracy, openness and accessibility. Precisely none of those principles can be said to exist in your privacy policy if a user can’t even read it without getting a headache

Keep in mind, unlike a regular commercial contract, a privacy policy requires a user (usually with limited legal knowledge) to unconditionally agree to the terms. If that’s the case, they should at least understand what they’re agreeing to!

If complaints about mishandling user data come up, and your privacy policy is seen as intentionally unhelpful, PIPEDA imposes **hefty penalties**, not to mention the **costs of litigation** and **loss of reputation** which follow. In sum, a [well written privacy policy](https://www.clausehound.com/legal-contract/privacy-policy26) is your first line of defence.

# Make Your Privacy Policy Reader-friendly

To that end, we have **four tips** to help make your privacy policy a more reader-friendly document. None of these tips are, by any means, revolutionary - but the simplest solutions are often overlooked!

## 1. Use Headings and Subheadings
This one should just be common courtesy. Descriptive headings written in a prominent font, size, colour, or position can assist users in flagging down the clauses they are looking for, especially if they’re scrolling or using a browser’s search function.

## 2. Use a Table of Contents and Hyperlinks
Even prominent headers can start to blur together in a longer document, particularly if they have users frantically whirring mousewheels or swiping screens. In this case, hyperlinking cross-references and technical terms to their definition with a single click is a simple fix. In the same vein, users may appreciate a “Table of Contents” section or nav-bar which lines up with section headers, allowing users to jump quickly from section to section or page to page. This is particularly useful with longer documents.

## 3. Keep It Simple - Avoid Jargon and Complex Sentences

“Keeping it simple” is easier said than done, since certain concepts in privacy are inherently complex, but this step may involve presenting that concept as simply as possible **without losing the underlying meaning**. It is highly recommended to **verify with a lawyer** that this is indeed the case with any simplified language.

However, there are many good examples of privacy policies which are written simply, such as the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/privacy-policy/)’s which you can refer to so you’re not reinventing the wheel. Of course, it’s up to you (and your counsel) to make sure that any specific policies affecting your business are captured in your case.

## 4. Keep It Specific - Avoid Bloated Text and Vagueness

A bad privacy policy will drone on about things users don’t care about, like the exact technical process used to back up user data, and gloss over what they actually care about, like what specific data is being collected and sold to third parties, if any.

Consider the case of [Unroll.me](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/04/25/unroll-me-backlash-shows-us-exactly-whats-wrong-with-privacy-policies/), an add-on which helped users clean up their inbox by removing unwanted marketing and subscription emails. Their privacy policy simply stated: “We may collect, use, transfer, sell, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.” What this meant, in practice, was that the company was mining user’s emails for purchase receipts and selling the data (e.g. selling Lyft receipt data to Uber).

To seasoned tech entrepreneurs, that might seem like common practice, but Unroll.me users were left feeling deceived. As such, make sure users understand what data you will be collecting (e.g. what is non-personal data) and illustrate, through example, how it can be used.

Having a good privacy policy in place is a great first step, but it isn’t enough to merely have one. There must be measures in place to actually monitor, protect, backing-up, and retrieve user data in accordance with your policy and PIPEDA - but that’s where the process crosses from the domain of law into tech.
