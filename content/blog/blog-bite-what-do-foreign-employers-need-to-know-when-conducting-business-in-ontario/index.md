[This article posted on our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/canada/x/498204/employee+rights+labour+relations/Employment+Law+Doing+Business+In+Canada+Focus+On+Ontario+Part+I+Employment+And+Termination) is a must-read for foreign employers operating their businesses in Canada. 

It helps employers identify and understand the differences in **Canadian and American employment law**. For example, a Canadian employer must provide a reason for dismissal unlike in the US where employees can be fired “at will”. It also covers useful topics such as statutory notice, severance, duty to mitigate, resignation, unilateral changes to employment terms and restrictive covenants.
