[This article posted to our partner site Mondaq.com](http://www.mondaq.com/uk/x/654726/Discrimination+Disability+Sexual+Harassment/The+Qualified+Right+To+Flout+NonDisclosure+Agreements) discusses how, within the context of **whistleblowing**, an employer's confidentiality agreement with an employee might be unenforceable. 

It mentions the **criteria that the employee must meet** in order to disclose the information: 
- (1) they reasonably believe their allegation to be true, 
- (2) they arenâ€™t acting for personal gain, 
- (3) they have already blown the whistle to the employer or appropriate regulatory body, and 
- (4) that making the disclosure is reasonable in all circumstances.
